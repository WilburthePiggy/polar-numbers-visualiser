# polar-numbers-visualiser
A simple D3 visualisation of numbers plotted in polar coordinates. For a number *n*, they are plotted as (n,n). Fork it if you're bored.

## master.html
That contains the html and js scripts to visualise the numbers. 

Eventual progression:
1. Changing scale - for both phi and radial values.
2. Colouring by residues

## text files and primeparse
raw and clean prime numbers - raided from "https://primes.utm.edu/lists/small/10000.txt"
slapped primeparse together in 3 minutes to do the cleaning.
